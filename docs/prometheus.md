prometheus_config__file: "{{ prometheus_config_dir }}/prometheus.yml"
# Prometheus configuration file name.

prometheus_log__format: "logfmt"
# Output format of log messages. One of: [logfmt,json]

prometheus_web__listen_address: ":9090"

prometheus_web__page_title: "Prometheus Time Series Collection and Processing Server"
# Document title of Prometheus instance.

prometheus_web__external_url:
# The URL under which Prometheus is externally reachable (for
# example, if Prometheus is served via a reverse proxy). Used for
# generating relative and absolute links back to Prometheus itself. If the
# URL has a path portion, it will be used to prefix all HTTP endpoints
# served by Prometheus. If omitted, relevant URL components will be derived
# automatically.

prometheus_web__route_prefix:
# Prefix for the internal routes of web endpoints. Defaults to path
# of .web.external.url.

prometheus_web__user_assets:
# Path to static asset directory, available at /user.

# Path to the console template directory, available at /consoles.

prometheus_web__console__libraries: 'console_libraries'
# Path to the console library directory.

prometheus_storage__tsdb__path: "{{ prometheus_data_dir }}"

# The delta difference allowed for retrieving metrics during expression evaluations.

prometheus_query__timeout: '2m'
# Maximum time a query may take before being aborted.

prometheus_rules__alert__for_grace_period: '10m'
# Minimum duration between alert and restored
# 'for' state. This is maintained only for alerts
# with configured 'for' time greater than grace
# period.

prometheus_rules__alert__for_outage_tolerance: '1h'
# Max time to tolerate prometheus outage for
# restoring 'for' state of alert.

prometheus_rules__alert__resend_delay: '1m'

# an alert to Alertmanager.

prometheus_storage__remote__flush_deadline:
# How long to wait flushing sample on shutdown or
# config reload.

prometheus_storage__remote__read_concurrent_limit: 10
# Maximum number of concurrent remote read calls.
# 0 means no limit.

prometheus_storage__remote__read_sample_limit: '5e7'
# Maximum overall number of samples to return via
# the remote read interface, in a single query. 0 means no limit.

prometheus_query__max_concurrency: 20
# Maximum number of queries executed concurrently.

prometheus_query__max_samples: 50000000
# Maximum number of samples a single query can
# load into memory. Note that queries will fail
# if they would load more samples than this into
# memory, so this also limits the number of
# samples a query can return.

prometheus_log__level: 'info'
# Only log messages with the given severity or above. Valid levels:
# [debug, info, warn, error, fatal].
